# Omidia
The Omidia Web Service suite provides service modules that can be used to create feature rich but individual websites.

It gives every user the power to choose from a variety of features that can be independently implemented on one's own site. 
Thus, Omidia enables the federation of the World Wide Web and brings freedom to the internet.
